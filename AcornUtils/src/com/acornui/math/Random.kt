 * This class implements the xorshift128+ algorithm that is a very fast, top-quality 64-bit pseudo-random number generator. The
 * quality of this PRNG is much higher than {@link Random}'s, and its cycle length is 2<sup>128</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, which
 * is more than enough for any single-thread application. More details and algorithms can be found <a
 * href="http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/">here</a>.
 * <p>
 * Instances of RandomXS128 are not thread-safe.
