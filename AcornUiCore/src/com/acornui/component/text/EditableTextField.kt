	copy,
	//Creates an anchor link from the selection, only if there is a selection. This requires the HREF URI string to be passed in as a value argument. The URI must contain at least a single character, which may be a white space. (Internet Explorer will create a link with a null URI value.)

	//Cuts the current selection and copies it to the clipboard. Conditions of having this behavior enabled vary from one browser to another, and have evolved over time. Check the compatibility table for knowing if you can use it in your case.

	//Adds an HTML block-style tag around the line containing the current selection, replacing the block element containing the line if one exists (in Firefox, BLOCKQUOTE is the exception - it will wrap any containing block element). Requires a tag-name string to be passed in as a value argument. Virtually all block style tags can be used (eg. "H1", "P", "DL", "BLOCKQUOTE"). (Internet Explorer supports only heading tags H1 - H6, ADDRESS, and PRE, which must also include the tag delimiters < >, such as "<H1>".)
	formatBlock,
	//Deletes the character ahead of the cursor's position.  It is the same as hitting the delete key.
	forwardDelete,
	//Adds a heading tag around a selection or insertion point line. Requires the tag-name string to be passed in as a value argument (i.e. "H1", "H6"). (Not supported by Internet Explorer and Safari.)
	heading,
	//Changes the background color for the selection or at the insertion point. Requires a color value string to be passed in as a value argument. UseCSS must be turned on for this to function. (Not supported by Internet Explorer.)

	//Creates a numbered ordered list for the selection or at the insertion point.
	insertOrderedList,
	//Creates a bulleted unordered list for the selection or at the insertion point.
	insertUnorderedList,
	//Inserts a paragraph around the selection or the current line. (Internet Explorer inserts a paragraph at the insertion point and deletes the selection.)
